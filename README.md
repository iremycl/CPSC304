## Database Specification

Benefits that this database provides to the application is a centralized space where users can query different statistics about Team Canada’s participation in past Olympics. This database allows users to view and compare Team Canada’s performance and resources that went into attending the Olympics during different years. 

- This database gives users the functionality to query the database based on:
- People involved (whether that be athletes, coaches, or managers). Additionally, indicating whether athletes participated in individual sports or team sports
- Sports Canada participated 
- Host country that held the game
- Sponsors that support the athletes 
- Income that financed the people involved 
- Medals won by the athletes
- Media broadcasts (how the sports were broadcasted)


## Application Platform

Our application technology stack will be PHP and Oracle SQL.
